Description: File integrity verification tool using MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 hashes
 This tool calculates and verifies the integrity of files using multiple
 cryptographic hash algorithms (MD5, SHA1, and SHA256).
 .
 Features:
  * Calculate MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes
  * Verify file integrity against provided hashes
  * Interactive hash comparison
  * Support for files with spaces in names
  * Cross-platform support (Windows and Linux)
 .
 Usage:
  hash -f <file_path>
  After calculating hashes, you can optionally enter a hash value for verification.
